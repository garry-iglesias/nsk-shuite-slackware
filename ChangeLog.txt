Initial ChangeLog message.
This file will be the public brief for the NoStress Kommando Shell Suite for
Slackware.

Those tools were in-house projects. They will be released publicly and
are not yet full-featured, and bug-free. Also documentation is sparse
and should be improved "on demand".

    * NoStress Kustom Slackware: A Slackware ISO customization tool.

This utility have been developed over the period of 2013-2016 for internal
server and workstation deployment as a Slackware Installation customizer.

It's been rewritten with focus on Live ISO generation, legacy customized
installer not yet upgraded.
